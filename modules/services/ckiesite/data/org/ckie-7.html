<b>NAME</b><nekobed></nekobed>
    ckie - unsafe distributed system occasionally capable of advanced thought

<b>SYNOPSIS</b><nekobed></nekobed>
    ckie 'hello! wow how are you today? great! great yeah that's good yeah great stuff'
    # => exit(1)

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><nekobed></nekobed>
    This documententation serves to both ease interaction with me and help with getting along in
    a divided world. The things omitted are worth more than the things written here. I don't beli-
  … eve everyone can get along but I'd like there to be less drama and hate within our
    communities.

    Fear shuts your mouth and failing to point out when something feels wrong may be singlehanded-
  … ly the reason we've made each other upset. First, we'll start with what you can do before
    moving onto <todo>an overall view of what I've seen happen</todo>.

    <b>INTERACTION</b><nekobed></nekobed>
        <b>ckie</b> likes to interact with beings who are similar to them.
        <b>ckie</b>s are often found analyzing abstract things which may or may not actually end up be-
      … ing applied to real problems. Conversations with <b>ckie</b> are optimized for satisfaction
        and are formed upon a (usually implicitly implied) contract between the participants.

        <b>ERRORS</b>
            <u>REMORSE</u>
                Ideally, interactions with <b>ckie</b> are never to be left in an intermediary st-
              … ate with withheld information. <b>ckie</b> tries to be open with participants to
                avoid <b>REMORSE</b>, but this is not always successful. Common reasons are:

                <u>A participant feels <b>ckie</b> would not accept some information.</u>

                <u>A participant has already had a similar conversation</u>, is not interested in re-
              … petition, OR believes the conversation will not yield anything new.

                <u>A participant has had experiences conflicting with their partner</u> and cannot emoti-
              … nally reconcile. This is okay.

            <u><b>HANDLING</b></u>
                <b>ckie</b> will usually attempt to examine errors to determine the root cause.
                This may even happen for minuscule errors, but is a vital function for avoiding
                further likely mutual distress. Patience may be required.

        <b>STYLE</b>
            <b>ckie</b>'s preferred conversation styles highly vary based on their state.
            Participants deemed sufficiently confident by <b>ckie</b> may be told when the conversa-
          … tion is not currently acceptable. Typical acceptable styles are mutually benefical.

<b>NOTES</b><nekobed></nekobed>
    <b>READING</b>
        <b>OR</b> is to be interpreted as non-exclusive unless otherwise stated.
        <b>WRITING</b>
        I think I might make all of https://ckie.dev just this one page and just perpetually grow it.
        I kind of struggle with keeping a consistent style and that's why I'm doing the
        whole manpage thing. It has a feeling to it.

        It's generic and gives me like, an idea of who I'm writing this for, something which I
        rarely have when writing my usual stuff. The formality forces me to think my thoughts
        through and that's very helpful when my default is tightly-encoded blabber that doesn't
        make sense for anyone else but me.
