#+TITLE: TODO List

* List
- [X] ronthecookie.me
- [X] personalcdn
  + [X] rename to something less cringe
  + [X] this will require secrets, means we need to revise ~nix-path.nix~
- [X] comicfury
- [X] owo_bot
- [X] ffg_bot
- [X] Prometheus
- [X] znc
- [X] setup minecraft on bokkusu
- [X] secure ssh (root login, etc)
- [X] synapse (depends on ~ckie.dev~)
- [X] use ~systemd-analyze security~ on all of the above
  + [X] rtcme
  + [X] files
  + [X] comicfury
  + [X] owo_bot
  + [X] ffg_bot
- [X] mail: replace mbsync with the ~emacsclient --eval '(mu4e-update-mail-and-index 1)'~-on-a-timer solution
- [X] individual mail addresses:
  #+BEGIN_SRC irc
    2021-06-19 16:57:13 ckie    also that is another reason for setting this up! I get to have randomized addresses for stuff like github
    2021-06-19 16:57:36 ckie    so I'm going to completely overengineer it and make all the addresses for services salted hashes
  #+END_SRC
- [X] secure postgres better
- [X] set ~users.mutableUsers~ to false
- [-] setup prom
  + [X] deploy on bokkusu
  + [ ] collect data from other hosts
  + [ ] add coredns exporter
- [ ] set home-manager ~xdg.mimeApps~
- [X] investigate ~fish~ more
  https://fishshell.com/docs/current/fish_for_bash_users.html
- [-] backup
  + [X] ~/var/lib/rtc-files~
  + [X] postgres (use ~services.postgresqlBackup~)
  + [X] znc logs
  + [X] synapse media
  + [X] [[https://nixos-mailserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backup-guide.html][mail]]
    + ~/var/vmail~
    + +~/var/dkim~+
  + [X] minecraft
  + [ ] get drive(s): https://ksp.co.il/web/item/19543

** Backburner
- [ ] move each service/module into its own folder like nixpkgs' pkgs so we can eliminate ~ext~
- [ ] setup wg

* Hostname Ideas
Deprecated, use Xe's [[https://github.com/Xe/waifud/blob/main/data/names.json][names.json]].
- [X] bokkusu
- [X] nifles

* Tailscale/Nix+WireGuard comparison
** Usecase
- I want to have a private Nix binary cache. (Store contents are slightly sensitive due to e.g. the matrix-synapse service not providing a secure way to set the registration token)
  + Cas already wrote a module, but untested: ~modules/services/nix-serve.nix~
- Remove the yucky state from the ~.ssh/config~ file. ~ProxyJump~ blah bla bla.
- Central CoreDNS daemon? Probably a bad idea because of latency.
- KDE Connect working across networks!!
