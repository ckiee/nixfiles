#+TITLE: TODO List

* List
- [X] ronthecookie.me
- [X] personalcdn
  + [X] rename to something less cringe
  + [X] this will require secrets, means we need to revise ~nix-path.nix~
- [X] comicfury
- [X] owo_bot
- [X] ffg_bot
- [X] Prometheus
- [X] znc
- [X] setup minecraft on bokkusu
- [X] secure ssh (root login, etc)
- [X] synapse (depends on ~ckie.dev~)
- [X] use ~systemd-analyze security~ on all of the above
  + [X] rtcme
  + [X] files
  + [X] comicfury
  + [X] owo_bot
  + [X] ffg_bot
- [ ] backup
  + [ ] postgres (use ~services.postgresqlBackup~)
  + [ ] ~/var/lib~
  + [ ] znc
  + [ ] synapse
  + [ ] mail
  + [ ] whatever else I missed
- [ ] mail: replace mbsync with the ~emacsclient --eval '(mu4e-update-mail-and-index 1)'~-on-a-timer solution
- [ ] setup wg
- [ ] setup prom
  + [ ] improve module a bit
  + [ ] deploy on bokkusu
  + [ ] add coredns exporter
- [ ] set ~users.mutableUsers~ to false

** Backburner
- [ ] move each service/module into its own folder like nixpkgs' pkgs so we can eliminate ~ext~
- [ ] individual mail addresses:
  #+BEGIN_SRC irc
    2021-06-19 16:57:13 ckie    also that is another reason for setting this up! I get to have randomized addresses for stuff like github
    2021-06-19 16:57:36 ckie    so I'm going to completely overengineer it and make all the addresses for services salted hashes
  #+END_SRC
- [ ] secure postgres better

** Hostname Ideas
Just use Xe's [[https://github.com/Xe/waifud/blob/main/data/names.json][names.json]].
- [X] bokkusu
- [X] nifles
